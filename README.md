# Movie Rating prediction using linear model with R
This is the final project for Linear Regression and Modelling class which is part of the Statistics With R specialisation course on Coursera, provided by Duke University.

In this project, my boss was interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular. 
I chose the Rating on IMDB as the independent variable, and try to find predictors for it. 
The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies.

I did Exploratory Data Analysis, trained the model with regression diagnosis, and then made acceptable prediction.

Thank you for your time and interest!
